# Flutter BottomNavigationBar

https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html
A material widget that's displayed at the bottom of an app for selecting among a small number of views, typically between three and five.

There is an updated version of this component, NavigationBar, that's preferred for new applications and applications that are configured for Material 3 (see ThemeData.useMaterial3).

The bottom navigation bar consists of multiple items in the form of text labels, icons, or both, laid out on top of a piece of material. It provides quick navigation between the top-level views of an app. For larger screens, side navigation may be a better fit.

A bottom navigation bar is usually used in conjunction with a Scaffold, where it is provided as the Scaffold.bottomNavigationBar argument.
